# <My Very first Study Guide Webpage!>

## Description

I created this study guide in order to learn a bit about coding before the bootcamp started. 
The motivation behind this project was to get some skill on my own in order to get the hang of coding.
This study guide solves the problems of worried students that are nervous about coding for the first time.
I learned alot about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaSript. Mostly learned about their uses and what each one does and is needed for in a website.

If you open the devtools on the website you can see how I utilized javascript into the website. You can even see it currently running listin all the topics I learned. The website is to be used in order to refresh your mind about what we'll be learning during the bootcamp.
